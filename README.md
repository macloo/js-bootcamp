# JS Bootcamp Working Files

Course: [Modern JavaScript Bootcamp (2018)](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript/learn/v4/content)

This is an up-to-date course with ES6.

The instructor uses VS Code as his editor. I tried it and did not like it, so I used Atom instead. This course is very good and well organized. Really starts at the beginning. Suitable for non-coders who are just starting out.

## Basics

Node is installed. The course is in the console throughout these first sections:

1. basics: variables, strings, numbers, Booleans, scope
2. functions: arguments, returns, null and undefined, more scope
3. objects: very basic; includes string and number methods, some Math; `objects-methods.js` shows several methods in an object
4. arrays: overlap with objects; for and forEach loops

## HTML and the DOM (JavaScript in the Browser)

Now we leave the console and start manipulating the DOM. We install live-server:

```
npm install -g live-server
```

1. notes-app: In `notes-app1.js` I listed a lot of JS commands he did not cover right away, because I was looking up jQuery equivalents. These are in a large comment at the end of the file.
2. todo-app: Instead of deleting early code, I saved it in `first-file.html` and `todo-app1.js`.

I'm doing things that in the past I have done only with jQuery. No jQuery here.
